This repository contains code examples for data ingestion and data profiling using Apache Spark.

### Data Ingestion : 
The process of loading data from external sources into a data warehouse or data lake. Spark provides a variety of tools for data ingestion.

We'll assess our data in line with the following data qualities:
- Accuracy
- Uniqueness
- Timeliness
- Validity
- Completeness
- Consistency
