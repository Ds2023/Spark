# Apache Spark

Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Structured Streaming for stream processing.
